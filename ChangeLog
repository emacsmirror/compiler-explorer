	Version 0.3.0

	- The source buffer now has a header line, with buttons to start a
	new session and to switch layouts.

	- Windows are now dedicated to their buffers during CE session.
	This is customizable via `compiler-explorer-dedicate-windows'.

	- The compilation/execution status is now displayed in the header
	line instead of the mode line, as it was often hidden on smaller
	screens.

	- Execution support is now detected for compilers.  If a compiler
	does not support execution, a proper message will now be displayed
	in the execution output buffer.  The previous behavior was to
	silently ignore this, and the user was not informed of that.
	`compiler-explorer-set-compiler' can now be called interactively
	with a prefix argument to select a compiler from the list of
	compilers that support execution.

	- The sessions file now uses `lisp-data-mode'.

	- Byte compilations errors/warnings were fixed.

	Version 0.2.0

	- New hook `compiler-explorer-params-change-hook' which runs when
	compilation parameters change (like arguments, execution input string).

	- Execution output buffer now recognizes ANSI escape codes.  With
	this, e.g. AddressSanitizer output is shown properly.

	- Lines in ASM buffer are now always truncated.

	- Various fixes
