	Version 0.6.1

	- Fixed shortlink generation after URL change in the API.

2024-11-29  Michał Krzywkowski  <k.michal@zoho.com>

	Version 0.6.0

	- Minimum Emacs version was bumped to 27.1 from 26.1.

	- New command `compiler-explorer-restore-from-link' restores a
	session from a shortlink generated by the website externally, or
	by `compiler-explorer-make-link'.

	- `compiler-explorer-previous-session' can now be called with a
	prefix argument to query for the session to restore.  The previous
	sessions can also be selected from the menu.

	- New command `compiler-explorer-discard-session' will discard the
	current or (with prefix argument) selected past session.

	- All overlays that relate to the same code block are now
	highlighted when point is inside of them.

	- A few small fixes and improvements.

2024-06-09  Michał Krzywkowski  <k.michal@zoho.com>

	Version 0.5.0

	- Implemented colored source line to ASM line mappings with
	overlays.  This can be toggled by setting the customizable
	variable `compiler-explorer-source-to-asm-mappings' or via the
	menu.  New command `compiler-explorer-jump' can be used to jump
	from source line to corresponding ASM line and vice versa.

	- Fixed output filters which are not supported by current
	language/compiler being set in the request.

	- List of languages in the menu is now sorted, and compilers are
	grouped.

	- Fixed an issue where a new session could not be interactively
	created when the default compiler for a language was invalid.

	- Switched from the old, and apparently no longer actively
	developed `request' package for HTTP requests to newer and
	actively developed `plz'.  **Note**: this makes compiler-explorer
	depend on curl being installed.

	- Added better protection against some external package/function
	messing buffer-local variables and modes which are required for
	compiler-explorer.  This was done by converting
	`compiler-explorer-mode' into a globalized minor mode which in
	turn enables an internal buffer-local mode that reliably sets up
	buffer-local variables.

	- Various fixes and smaller improvements.

2024-04-18  Michał Krzywkowski  <k.michal@zoho.com>

	Version 0.4.0

	- The "Debug Intrinsics" output filter can now be set.

	- Useless (unmodified) sessions are now not persisted.

	- The compilation and execution buffers are now updated
	non-destructively, i.e the point and window scroll is preserved
	when possible.

	- A menu bar is now available in compiler-explorer sessions.

	- New command `compiler-explorer-exit' kills the current session.

	- Documentation for ASM opcodes is now optionally provided via
	eldoc in the compilation buffers.  This is controlled by the
	`compiler-explorer-document-opcodes' defcustom.

	- New command `compiler-explorer-load-example' loads a named
	example for the current language.

	- The annoying "request--callback: peculiar error" message has
	been removed.

	- Various fixes and smaller improvements.

2024-03-28  Michał Krzywkowski  <k.michal@zoho.com>

	Version 0.3.0

	- The source buffer now has a header line, with buttons to start a
	new session and to switch layouts.

	- Windows are now dedicated to their buffers during CE session.
	This is customizable via `compiler-explorer-dedicate-windows'.

	- The compilation/execution status is now displayed in the header
	line instead of the mode line, as it was often hidden on smaller
	screens.

	- Execution support is now detected for compilers.  If a compiler
	does not support execution, a proper message will now be displayed
	in the execution output buffer.  The previous behavior was to
	silently ignore this, and the user was not informed of that.
	`compiler-explorer-set-compiler' can now be called interactively
	with a prefix argument to select a compiler from the list of
	compilers that support execution.

	- The sessions file now uses `lisp-data-mode'.

	- Byte compilations errors/warnings were fixed.

2022-11-08  Michał Krzywkowski  <k.michal@zoho.com>

	Version 0.2.0

	- New hook `compiler-explorer-params-change-hook' which runs when
	compilation parameters change (like arguments, execution input string).

	- Execution output buffer now recognizes ANSI escape codes.  With
	this, e.g. AddressSanitizer output is shown properly.

	- Lines in ASM buffer are now always truncated.

	- Various fixes
