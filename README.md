# compiler-explorer.el #

Emacs package that provides a simple client for [compiler explorer][compiler-explorer] service.

## Usage ##

`M-x compiler-explorer` is the main entry point.  It will ask you for a
language and display source&compilation buffers.  Type something in the source
buffer; the compilation buffer will automatically update with compiled asm
code.  Another buffer displays output of the compiled and executed program.

`M-x compiler-explorer-set-compiler` changes the compiler for current session.

`M-x compiler-explorer-set-compiler-args` sets compilation options.

`M-x compiler-explorer-add-library` asks for a library version and adds it to
current compilation.  `M-x compiler-explorer-remove-library` removes them.

`M-x compiler-explorer-set-execution-args` sets the arguments for the executed
program.

`M-x compiler-explorer-set-input` reads a string from minibuffer that will be
used as input for the executed program.

`M-x compiler-explorer-jump` jumps to ASM block for the source line at point
and vice versa.

`M-x compiler-explorer-load-example` prompts for a name of a builtin example
and loads it.

`M-x compiler-explorer-new-session` kills the current session and creates a new
one, asking for source language.

`M-x compiler-explorer-previous-session` lets you restore previous sessions.

`M-x compiler-explorer-discard-session` kills the current or selected sessions
and forgets about them forever.

`M-x compiler-explorer-make-link` generates a link for current compilation so
it can be opened in a browser and shared.

`M-x compiler-explorer-restore-from-link` restores a session from a URL,
generated by the website or by this package.

`M-x compiler-explorer-layout` cycles between different layouts.

`M-x compiler-explorer-exit` kills the current session.
